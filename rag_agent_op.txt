┃    returns to a boil, season it with fish sauce.                                                ┃

┃  • Keep the heat low throughout the cooking process to prevent the coconut milk from            ┃
┃    separating.                                                                                  ┃
┃  • If using mature galangal, consider reducing the amount.                                      ┃
┃  • Lime juice is more aromatic when added after removing the pot from heat.                     ┃
┃  • Adjust chilies for your preferred level of spiciness.                                        ┃
